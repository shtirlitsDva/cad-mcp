    // Lifetime:
    //   - Constructed in TryEnsureCore, so it's wired as soon as the
    //     plugin's core is ready (well before the listener starts).
    //   - The actual palette (ScriptPaletteSet in AutoCAD, ScriptPanel in
    //     BricsCAD) is created on first EnsureVisible
    //     or first ACDMCP_PALETTE — whichever wins. BricsCAD also creates
    //     it at plugin load, so its icon is on the panel stack from the start.
    //   - The factory + sync context are captured at construction; the
    //     host never reaches back into McpPlugin statics, so it survives
    //     unit substitution.
    //
    // Thread safety: EnsureVisible marshals to the main thread via the
    // captured SynchronizationContext. CurrentBatchUiState and IsOpen
    // are simple reads — the palette field is assigned only once on the
    // main thread, so a torn read can't happen.
