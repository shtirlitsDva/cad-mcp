# acd-mcp — AutoCAD / Civil 3D

[< back to the repo overview](../README.md)

An MCP server that runs C# inside a live AutoCAD / Civil 3D process. The client sends C# code; it compiles with Roslyn, runs on AutoCAD's main thread under a document lock, and returns the result. State persists between calls.

## How it works

```
MCP client ─stdio─▶ Acd.Mcp.Bridge.exe ─named pipe─▶ AutoCAD (Acd.Mcp.dll)
```

* **`Acd.Mcp`** — AutoCAD plugin (`net8.0-windows8.0`, x64). Hosts the pipe server (`acd-mcp-{pid}`) and runs each request on the UI thread under `LockDocument()` through a persistent `CSharpScript` session.
* **`Acd.Mcp.Bridge`** — stdio MCP server (`net8.0`). Translates MCP calls to JSON-RPC over the pipe. Auto-discovers AutoCAD when one instance has the plugin loaded. To target a specific instance when several do, pass an optional `pid` on any tool call (per-call), or `--pid <N>` on the Bridge command line (session-wide default). See [Targeting an instance](#targeting-an-instance).

## Requirements

* **AutoCAD 2025+** (supplies the .NET 8 runtime the plugin loads into).
* **[.NET 8 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)** — the Bridge runs out-of-process and needs it (else `framework not found`).
* **Windows.**
* To build: **.NET 8 SDK**. AutoCAD is not required — references come from NuGet.

## Build

```powershell
dotnet build src/Autocad/Acd.Mcp/Acd.Mcp.csproj -c Release -p:Platform=x64
dotnet build src/Autocad/Acd.Mcp.Bridge/Acd.Mcp.Bridge.csproj -c Release -p:Platform=x64
```

Outputs: `src/Autocad/Acd.Mcp/bin/Release/Acd.Mcp.dll` (load into AutoCAD) and `src/Autocad/Acd.Mcp.Bridge/bin/Release/Acd.Mcp.Bridge.exe` (register with your MCP client). Building the two `.csproj` files directly is the fastest loop. `dotnet build CI.slnf` builds everything in the repo — both products and the shared kernel — and is what CI runs.

## How the plugin loads

One build, `dotnet build -c Release`, loadable either way.

| Loader | How |
|---|---|
| AutoCAD | `NETLOAD`, or the `.bundle` autoload |
| DevReload | point it at `src/Autocad/Acd.Mcp/Acd.Mcp.csproj` |

Under `NETLOAD` and the bundle, AutoCAD's `ExtensionLoader` scans the assembly and registers its `[CommandMethod]`s. DevReload suppresses that scan for assemblies it loads into its own `AssemblyLoadContext` and registers the commands itself through `Utils.AddCommand`, which is removable and so survives repeated reloads.

### NETLOAD

1. `dotnet build Acd.Mcp.csproj -c Release -p:Platform=x64`
2. In AutoCAD: `NETLOAD` -> `src/Autocad/Acd.Mcp/bin/Release/Acd.Mcp.dll`
3. `ACDMCP_PING` to verify (the pipe auto-starts on first idle).

### DevReload

Build with `dotnet build Acd.Mcp.csproj -c Release -p:Platform=x64`. [DevReload](https://github.com/shtirlitsDva/DevReload): point it at `src/Autocad/Acd.Mcp/Acd.Mcp.csproj`.

## Install

acd-mcp has two halves that install separately:

| Half | What it is | Where it comes from |
|---|---|---|
| **AutoCAD plugin** | `Acd.Mcp.dll` + deps, autoloaded by AutoCAD | **the release zip** |
| **MCP bridge** | `Acd.Mcp.Bridge.exe`, launched by your AI client | the plugin marketplace, *or* the same zip |

**The AutoCAD half ships only in the release zip.** The marketplace serves this repo's `plugins/acd-mcp/` folder, which carries the bridge but not the AutoCAD assemblies — those are build output. So every route below starts with the zip.

### Step 1 — the AutoCAD plugin (always)

Download `acd-mcp-plugin-v<X.Y.Z>.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/shtirlitsDva/cad-mcp/releases) and extract it somewhere permanent. Then, **with AutoCAD closed**:

```powershell
pwsh install-hooks\Install-Bundle.ps1
```

That deploys `ACD-MCP.bundle` into `%APPDATA%\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins\`, which AutoCAD autoloads at startup. Re-run it on every upgrade — it refuses to downgrade unless you pass `-Force`.

### Step 2 — the MCP bridge

Pick **one** route. Doing two of them double-registers the server.

**Claude Code** — also installs the `/acd-mcp:start|script|batch|add-dto` skills:

```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/shtirlitsDva/cad-mcp
/plugin install acd-mcp@cad-mcp
```

**Codex app** — also installs the skills. Settings → Plugins → Add marketplace → `shtirlitsDva/cad-mcp` → install **acd-mcp**.

**Copilot / Claude Desktop, or Codex without the marketplace** — from the same extracted zip:

```powershell
pwsh install-hooks\Install-Mcp.ps1
```

It auto-detects installed clients and writes `~/.codex/config.toml`, `%APPDATA%\Code\User\mcp.json`, or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`. Flags: `-Clients codex,copilot`, `-WhatIf`. Restart the client afterwards. This route gives you the tools but not the skills — those come only through a plugin install.

Keep the extracted folder where it is: `Install-Mcp.ps1` registers an absolute path into it, so moving or deleting it breaks the server.


### Inside AutoCAD

Launch AutoCAD 2025+. The bundle autoloads and auto-starts the pipe. Run `ACDMCP_PALETTE` for the SCRIPT + BATCH palette (propose calls auto-open it). To disable auto-start: create `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Acd.Mcp\config.json` with `{ "auto_start": false }`.

### Uninstall

```powershell
pwsh install-hooks\Uninstall-Mcp.ps1            # Copilot / Claude Desktop only
pwsh install-hooks\Uninstall-Bundle.ps1         # remove the bundle
pwsh install-hooks\Uninstall-Bundle.ps1 -Purge  # also delete DTOs, scripts, history, log
```

Claude Code: `/plugin uninstall acd-mcp@cad-mcp`. Codex app: uninstall from the Plugins panel.

## Build a release

```powershell
pwsh ./scripts/Build-Release.ps1 -Product acd            # → Deploy/acd-mcp-plugin-v<X.Y.Z>.zip
pwsh ./scripts/Build-Release.ps1 -Product acd -Publish   # also gh release create + upload
```

The two products in this repo version independently, so releases are tagged
per product: `acd-v<X.Y.Z>` here, `rvt-v<X.Y.Z>` for Revit. CI builds + tests
on every push; an `acd-v*` tag also builds this product's zip and uploads it
to the GitHub Release. So `git tag acd-vX.Y.Z && git push --tags` cuts a
release.

## Commands

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `ACDMCP_PING` | Version stamp — sanity check. |
| `ACDMCP_START` / `ACDMCP_STOP` | Start / stop the pipe listener. |
| `ACDMCP_STATUS` | Listener state, PID, pipe name, session state. |
| `ACDMCP_RESET` | Drop the script session (declared variables/usings gone). |
| `ACDMCP_PALETTE` | Open the SCRIPT + BATCH palette. |

The palette shares its script session with the MCP, so a `var` typed in the palette is visible to the next `autocad_script_execute`, and vice versa. Diagnostic log: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Acd.Mcp\log.txt`.

## MCP surface

Six tools, five resources. Every tool takes an optional **`pid`** (the AutoCAD process id) as its last argument — see [Targeting an instance](#targeting-an-instance).

### Tools

* **`autocad_script_execute(code, timeout_ms?, pid?)`** — run C# on the main thread under a doc lock. Globals: `Doc`, `Db`, `Ed`, `CivilDoc` (null in non-Civil drawings), `Acd`. Default imports cover `System`, LINQ, IO, Text and `Autodesk.AutoCAD.*`; add `using Autodesk.Civil.DatabaseServices;` yourself when needed. Declarations persist. Returns `ExecuteResult` (`success`, `return_value_json`, `elapsed_ms`, plus `stdout`, `stderr`, `diagnostics` only when non-empty).
* **`autocad_script_propose(name, script_body, input_summary?, pid?)`** — stage a single-drawing script in the SCRIPT palette for review.
* **`autocad_batch_propose_script(name, script_body, input_summary?, pid?)`** — save + load a batch script into the BATCH palette.
* **`autocad_batch_run_test(name?, pid?)`** — TEST-run the batch script over the selected folder/mask; opens each drawing read-shared and rolls back. There is no live-run tool — the user runs Live in person.
* **`autocad_batch_list_files(pid?)`** — return the BATCH palette's current folder, mask, recurse flag, and matched file list.
* **`autocad_get_selection(pid?)`** — return the active drawing's pickfirst selection (`document_name`, `document_path`, `count`, `entities[]`).

All tools except `autocad_script_execute` return a discriminated shape — check `ok` first; on failure read `error_message`. `autocad_script_execute` returns `ExecuteResult` directly (compile errors in `diagnostics`, runtime errors in `stderr`).

### Resources

* `acd-mcp://batch-runs/recent{?limit,offset}` — completed runs, newest first.
* `acd-mcp://batch-runs/{run_id}` — per-file result of one run.
* `acd-mcp://batch-runs/last` — most recent run.
* `acd-mcp://dto-system/diagnostics` — DTO files that failed to compile.
* `acd-mcp://status` — live capability snapshot (pipe/palette state, per-tool ready/degraded + error codes); read it when a tool returns a transport error.

### Targeting an instance

With a single AutoCAD that has `Acd.Mcp` loaded, omit `pid` — the Bridge finds it. With two or more loaded, pass `pid` (the AutoCAD process id) on the tool call to pick one; otherwise the Bridge returns error code `MULTIPLE_AUTOCAD_PLUGINS`. The `--pid <N>` Bridge CLI flag sets a session-wide default that a per-call `pid` overrides.

Transport error codes (surfaced in the failure shape / `stderr` and in the `acd-mcp://status` resource): `NO_AUTOCAD_FOUND`, `PIPE_NOT_LISTENING`, `AMBIGUOUS_AUTOCADS`, `MULTIPLE_AUTOCAD_PLUGINS`, `PINNED_PID_GONE`, `PIPE_BROKEN`.

## Limitations

* The snippet blocks AutoCAD's main thread. `timeout_ms` cancels at the next `CancellationToken` check; a spin loop can't be interrupted without killing AutoCAD.
* No sandbox — arbitrary C# runs in-process. Trusted-developer tool. The pipe relies on the default Windows named-pipe ACL (no custom ACL is set).
* Roslyn-emitted assemblies accumulate; `ACDMCP_RESET` drops session state, an AutoCAD restart frees the memory.
* Modal AutoCAD dialogs block the pipe until closed.
